### Build
To build the dist files use `grunt build` this will merge the demo files of each component and create the distributed version files.
Using `grunt` on it's own will run tests and build the project.

### Tests
Use `grunt test`

### How to create a new component
To create a new component you need to ensure you have yeoman.io installed (`sudo npm install -g yo`) and have got the angular-components generator installed.

`yo angular-components:component <name>`
